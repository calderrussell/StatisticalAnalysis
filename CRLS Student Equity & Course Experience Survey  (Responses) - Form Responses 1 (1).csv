Not every student learnt the same thing through their own public schools, like History, we could cover work over middle eastern wars, while I never had a chance to learn about it at all.

Supposedly, improve their attention towards more of the students than just more to their material they’re teaching the students (Finding a way to better state information in a way everyone can understand). As to be fair, not every student can just cover down the material the second they hear or read about it,  or even with the way the teacher explains what they’re talking about.

I want to share a personal story about this matter. My best friend, whom is also a 9th grader, has parents who did not go to college. The school we used to go to was not very good and I feel like they did not give out good resources for the students to work with. I was home schooled for 2 years between 5th to 6th grade, so, I was not there with my friend. When I came back in 7th grade my friend was failing almost all of her classes because she was hanging around the wrong crowd and because, even if her parents wanted to help her out, they couldn't because they didn't know any better. Since she is my best friend, my parents offered to take her with us to the library to finish homework every Wednesday. (My parents both graduated college and my dad has a PhD). My parents were able to teach her the things my school failed to. I forgot to mention the fact that my school was so bad that I had to re-learn the multiplication tables in 5th grade with my mom in home school because at my school they had not taught them properly at all. Anywho, my friend is now good with her grades! (she has mostly B's and some A's!). I feel that more elementary schools should have the opportunity to have tutors or to attempt encouraging the students to find a tutor that the district provides. In my school there was only one teacher that all of the students had really good grades with because she actually taught us properly and we understood. She was our science teacher between the years of 7th grade and 8th grade.
Anyways this is all I have to share.

Students dont really bother eachother and if they do its not about race anything like that. and teachers ive never seen any teacher discriminate or do anything against a kid because of race or background.,A mix of school and outside-school factors,I’m not sure,Neutral,Maybe,ive never seen the diversity in those classes before so idk because ive never been in it,Foundational,Neutral,Neutral,Yes,Agree,idk i thought CRLS was doing good but if there is issues i wasnt aware of and people feel like they are being treated un fairly strictly on race and background and not because of how good they do in classes then i think there needs to be change in the teachers actions or whoever is doing that to the students.,"you asked a question on how can we improve acheivement gaps, and if that means people arent doing well in school Im gonna share my opinion that this is mainly that students actions that lead them there because I did so bad all middle school and 9th grade because of the people i put myself around, the choices i was making to skip class or smoke and not focus etc. even though maybe i was depressed or going through stuff I still need to hold myself accountable at the end of the day that my actions got me to that point. i put everything above school. this year im doing better and i have A in every class because 1 i dont smoke like an idiot that was the stupidest thing  i ever did in my life and i wish nobody did it. 2 im putting in the effort to ask for help and to take notes and get the help I need i even got a 504 and diagnosed for ADHD all these stuff i didnt realize I had before and teachers didnt realize i needed because i never even stayed in class or tried. I think alot of the downfall of the kids in CRLS is all they do is smoke weed and drink and skip class to do exactly that.. its rare to find someone in this school who doesnt do that and actually cares about school. and dont get me wrong they probably are struggling mentally and need support but what can we do if they do not want help and they dont think they need support and they dont think school is important. because thats all i hear when i do try to help people who do that. even when i have close relationships with them like a best friend or a boyfriend everyone around them wants to help them they do not want it. nobody can force them to do anything they dont want to do except themselves. when it clicks that they need to change they will. because i have a huge support system and i still did so bad for 4 years straight  because i was making that choice, I didnt realize the people around me affect that they had on me.",

Family resources and communication gaps are also very big factors, as certain families have access to information that others do not. This creates a large gap and is extremely unfair because certain students who are fully capable of challenging themselves are unable to do so simply because they are unaware of the paths available to them. This information is typically hidden and helps families who are either supper attentive to everything going on in the school and actively prying information, or for families who have already had older siblings attend CRLS.","Mostly factors inside the school (policies, tracking, teacher expectations, course structures)","Expanding academic support (tutoring, office hours, advocates), More communication with families, Community and family support programs outside school",Agree,Yes,I think the fact that they encourage underprivileged students to take higher level classes is good but they are missing the overall point. Creating harder level courses for everyone is not a good idea as it harms the students who are on a higher academic level. I think the best way would be to equal everything out by giving more resources and information to families about access to accelerated pathways. Obviously this won't fix everything but it would be better if there was way more course clarity and opportunities were made to be more accessible.
