# StatisticalAnalysis
This project analyzes whether there is a statistical difference in the distribution of ethnicities in high- and low-level classes compared to the overall student population at Cambridge Rindge and Latin. The analysis leverages Python for statistical testing and data visualization to explore patterns and uncover insights into educational equity.
# Methodology
## Data Collection:

Enrollment data by ethnicity was collected from individual teachers.
School-wide demographic data was sourced from Massachusetts Department of Education.
## Statistical Analysis:

Chi-Square tests were conducted to compare observed ethnic distributions in classes with expected distributions based on school-wide data.
Visualization:

Bar plots, scatterplots, and heatmaps were created to visualize data and results.
